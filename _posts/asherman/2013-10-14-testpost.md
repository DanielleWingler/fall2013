Well, I suppose if you are reading this, it worked!
Like Kyle and Christopher, following the directions from the class notes
made this pretty simple.  I think I prefer the github.com way of making posts,
but this works too.

I do have two questions though:

Does the "$" I get when I type past the length of the terminal just mean that it is starting a new line?

How does the localhost site work? Did Elliott set that up in advance or
will that be true for whatever directory we use?
