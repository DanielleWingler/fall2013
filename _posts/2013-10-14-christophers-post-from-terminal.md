##Look Ma! I'm learning to use the command line!

This is my first post from the terminal. I wasn't sure it was going to work at first because I recently swapped out the superdrive on my macbook pro for a SSD. When I got the new SSD up and running, I lost all of my applications, settings, etc. One of the main things I lost was my setting for VirtualBox, so I decided to just run Ubuntu off of Parallels 9, and I'm happy that I did because it's so much faster now. 

Well, it looks like everything is working fine. Now let's see if I can push to Github.
