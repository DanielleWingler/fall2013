Any guesses as to when Python was invented? 2006? 1998? 1992? It may surprise you to learn that the first implementation of Python was 1989 and it was first published in 1991. [**Guido van Rossum**](http://www.python.org/~guido/) created it in the Netherlands while working for Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI).

If this history makes you so excited that you want to go out and get PYTHON for your license plate, too bad - Van Rossum has it already!
