In honor of UNC Basketball starting up again, I decided to theme the Star Pusher pygame after the sport I will never understand. 

The first thing I did was change the Bright Blue RGB code for the game background into a Carolina Blue background like so:

Next I created some new images using Adobe Illustrator and then changed the size so that they would display properly in the game. Anything over 50 x 85 px per image would make the images disappear (This is not the case for the title page). After creating the images, I placed the files in the Star Pusher folder and changed the following images in the IMAGESDICT:

* 'star'
* 'title'
* 'boy'
* 'rock'
* 'short tree'
* 'tall tree'
* 'ugly tree'

With the code looking like so:

After that, I deleted all of the characters in the PLAYERIMAGES list except for the 'boy' player, which ended up looking like so:

Next, I changed the instructionText to read as follows:

After all of the changes this is how it looked in the end!
