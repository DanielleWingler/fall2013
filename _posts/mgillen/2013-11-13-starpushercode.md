I did a very simple hack on the Starpusher game. I chose remodel the game through pictures and colors, specifically Link chasing chickens. Here are my results:

This is the title screen that greets the player.

This is what gameplay looks like. Rather than stars, we have chickens! But don't pick them up because they may attack...

The background color was modified by looking up the RGB code for green. 

```python
green = (76, 153, 0)
white = (255, 255, 255)
bgcolor = green
textcolor = white
```

The pictures were modified by replacing other pictures with my own and even adding in new ones.
