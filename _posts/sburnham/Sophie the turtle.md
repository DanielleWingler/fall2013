Hello all - meet Sophie. Below, you will find the code I used to create Sophie the turtle. I wanted to experiment using multiple colors (including a background color) as well as making a few types of shapes. 

The initial lines got me started, and after drawing a cicle, I felt it necessary to close the triangle I started making. I borrowed some code from [this site](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/hello_little_turtles.html) to create the spiral. I played and manipulated how long it is, how wide it spirals and how far apart each dot is before settling on this one.
