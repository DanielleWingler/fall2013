This is the first time I have posted from the command line.  I have used the command line before, but just for simple tasks, like changing directories, listing contents, or running a php script (that I did not write), so this was a new experience.  The process itself was not difficult, it was the complications along the way that made the task take longer and be more cumbersome.  First, I could not get git pages to install because my ruby was not the right version, and then I could not get the right version of ruby to work.  Once that was taken care of, I realized that I had put my class id as my github name, so my pages would not add properly.  Thankfully, Elliott noticed this and helped me to correct it.  Lastly, I did not update the pages before adding new content, so github freaked out on me and I turned to the Google Plus community for answers.  Grant and Elliott both offered suggestions, and I think I have it working now.  Takeaway from this:  always update first.  It saves a lot of trouble later on.

Overall, the process has been informative.  I'm still trying to completely wrap my head around what the vocabulary does in the command line.  My biggest worry is accidentally breaking the site.  The command line just seems so much more intimidating than working with normal files.  Although, I do feel like I'm playing War Games everytime I do something, which is awesome.

I had already closed one of my terminal by the time I took the screenshot, so it's not very informative, but here it is.

This is my first post from the command line.  I'm used to a small amount of work in the command line, but this was much more than what I have worked with before.  I also ran into a lot of errors because my ruby wasn't updated right, and I put in my github user name wrong, so it would not commit to GitHub the first time through.  Aside from that, the actual act of creating the post was not too difficult, thanks in part to the detailed instructions from Elliott.  The instructions made the post much easier to create because when I did run into issues during class and had to try and fix that, I could easily go back to the instructions without feeling like I was completely lost since everyone else might be a step or two ahead.  
The only other problem I encountered is that nano was running slightly slower than normal.  I would input the nano command and it would not come up immediately as normal, so I would wait and wait, and if didn't come up, I would start typing again, and then nano would pop up, but it would have a weird filename since it was taken from the text I had just typed.  Once I figured out that it was running more slowly, I would just wait for it to pop up, and if it took too long, I would quit and try again.  I'm hoping this was just 
My screen shot isn't very descriptive because I had already closed one of the terminal windows, but here it is.
