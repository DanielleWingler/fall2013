I went really simply since I didn't have much time to explore Turtle today, so here is a pretty rainbow colored line that leads into a black circle.

```python
#Turtledemo
import turtle
edward = turtle.Turtle()
edward.circle(100)
edward.position()
(-0.00,-0.00)

for color in ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'purple']:
   edward.color(color)
   edward.backward(50)

turtle.done()
```
