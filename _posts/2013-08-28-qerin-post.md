Today I learned all about alternate realities. It seemed like a scary thought at first, but after hopping back and forth between them a couple of times, it actually wasn't too bad. I still can't say I understand everything about the different realities, but the more I go back and forth between them, the better I'll feel about it. I have added a title to the header and below I'm going to attempt to use Javascript to print **Hello World!**, mostly because I'm too scared to do much beyond that right now!

```javascript
document.write("Hello World!");
```
