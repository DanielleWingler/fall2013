Wednesday Aug 28th Readings:

1. Comoyo: [How we built our company blog](http://comoyo.github.io/blog/2012/06/11/how-comoyo-built-its-blog/) - Evidence that what we’re doing isn’t totally out of left field.  For bonus points, dig into some of the source code of their site.

2. Software Carpentry: [Computational Thinking](http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/softeng/principles.html) - This is intended as a wrap-up essay but I often find it useful to ‘start at the end’.  Use the essay to orient yourself to concepts that we’ll be learning.

- [ ] In-Class Exercise: Write a simple post with syntax highlighting.

- [x] In-Class Exercise: Open your first pull request

- [x] In-Class Exercise: Close your first pull request

- [ ] In-Class: Set up VirtualBox Ubuntu. Extra credit for helping peers install outside of class. This is due by the end of the week.  Post to our Google community if you're having trouble setting it up and someone will help you out.
