##Contributor Guidelines:

We welcome contributions, but there are a few things to keep in mind when you contribute to this site, such as:

1.  Fork (clone) the repo so that you can make changes to your branch without intially changing the overall site.
2.  Make changes within your brach.
3.  Once you've made the changes, open a pull request.
4.  Make it clear when you label the pull request what you have changed and what you are asking.
5.  Never close your own pull request.
