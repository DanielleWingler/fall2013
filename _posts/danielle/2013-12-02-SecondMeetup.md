title: Second meetup at HackAfternoon
---

I went to a meetup at Splatspace in Durham. It was a hack afternoon event that I attended on a Saturday during fall break in
October. 

A few people came in already working on projects for their raspberry pi. When I mentioned that never played around with one
they were very welcoming and let me set one up that was already sitting around in the work space.

I spent the entire time setting the raspberry pi up.
