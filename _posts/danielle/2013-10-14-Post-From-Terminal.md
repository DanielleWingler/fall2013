## How to post from your terminal to the class site:

Here are the steps you need to perform in order to post from the command line. 

- Install Jekyll and Github-pages
- Make sure you are running ruby 1.9
- Clone your version of the class website
- Make sure origin is your version of the class site & upstream is the actual class  
- Create your post
- Add, commit, & view the post locally
- Push to Origin & open pull request


## Checking to make sure you are running the correct version of ruby

```
ruby -v
```
If the result in your terminal is not 1.9 then you will need to change to that version manually by typing in:

```
sudo update-alternatives --config ruby
```
Follow the instructions provided to switch to the 1.9 version of ruby.
