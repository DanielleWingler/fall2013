SILShack, Fall 2013
===================

This is the source code for the collaboratively edited blog/site for the Fall 2013 session of UNC INLS 560, Programming for Information Professionals.

As the course goes on, you'll learn how to use git and Github to help make this site better and add your voice.  To start, check out the [site itself](http://silshack.github.com/fall2013).

This site is built off of [Professor Jekyll](http://github.com/silshack/professorjekyll), a collaborative course blog with support for multiple authors based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  The site is hosted by [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).
